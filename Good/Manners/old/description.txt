GoodManners defines what a `Store` is and gives you tools to interact with one. 
In this, it also provides a mechanism that can be given to GoodService when
creating its classes, which will turn those into `Stores`.
The most obvious way to use GoodManners is with Good... and use them together
as an interface to your database. However, the idea is that you can use another
way of storing the store without any changes to your production code.
The goal of GoodManners is to make the layer between the model and the persistent
storage. This clearly places it in the realm of the Model in MVC.

GoodManners was the first model work was done on after GoodLooking. However, this
code all got rewritten at least twice before any version of GoodManners was actually
made. Good... had received its first prototype, but before doing any work on it, I 
decided I wanted to make the real version work with the Database abstraction provided 
by The Good Suite.
At first, that was actually what GoodManners was, a database abstraction layer. Over
time, though, I made diffferent things out of it. One of the versions was built on
joins and specified a syntax for working with joined tables.
A major change came when I made GoodManners more abstract, meaning it could now not
just be used to store things in databases, but in anything you wrote another storing
class for. Basically, the changes started with me getting stuck.
I wanted a system that was both extensible itself (think about adding a new datatype)
and new Storing classes could be written for, while sticking to the Open/Closed
principle. This can be classified as "The Extension Problem". The project went on a
long hiatus because I got stuck.
When I got back to the project, I didn't solve the problem. Instead, I just gave up
the Open/Closed principle and decided the dependency system would have to handle it.
What I did do, though, was cut what was then GoodManners up in the different pieces
you know it as now: GoodRolemodel, GoodService, the current GoodManners and Good...
This way, it didn't get to be the first component (after GoodLooking, of course) to
get a version made. That honor went to GoodRolemodel instead. I do feel I should add
that it wasn't any more than an unnamed version sitting on my computer until after
GoodManners was also done, though.
