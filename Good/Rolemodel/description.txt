GoodRolemodel reads datamodel files and makes an abstract model tree out of it
for use by other components of The Good Suite. Basically, this allows you to
make language independent models and use them wherever (as the database
structure, as the model server-side and as the model client-side, for example).
As you may have notices, it often takes an important place in the Model
part of MVC, though it will often do its work mostly behind the scenes.

Surprising as it may be, this is actually the second component of The Good
Suite to have been written.
The second component work was done on was GoodManners, but at the time it was
atill something different than it is now. Basically, I tried some different
ways of making the GoodManners, until I finally got stuck on what could be
described as "The Expression Problem".
The project went on a hiatus. When I returned, I didn't solve the problem
(instead, I decided the dependency system would just have to take care of it), 
but one thing I did do was cut up what was then supposed to become GoodManners
into what is now GoodRolemodel, GoodService, what is left in GoodManners and
perhaps even Good... (though this way of handling it was planned already, I
don't remember if it was planned all inside GoodManners or already as different
components).
Of those, GoodRolemodel was the first to be built.
