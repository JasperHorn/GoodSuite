GoodFriend is the component installer of the Good Suite.
If it finds itself and/or the base system not installed, it installs those.
After that, you can use it to install components present but not installed.

As soon as The Good Suite came into being - which was after GoodLooking had
already come its second version (INT02) - it became clear that there was going
to be quite the number of components. As such, an installer for them quickly
sprang to mind.
The name GoodFriend was also decided on fairly quickly. I don't know which name
was first of GoodManners, GoodFriend and GoodSport, but GoodSport is no longer
called that (it's Good... now), so I guess it only has to share the title of 
first to be named with GoodManners now.
However, the actual making of GoodFriend wasn't something that happened so soon.
In the early stages of the Suite, I kept pushing it off and off until I actually
needed it and until things were actually comnig together a bit.
One advantage this gave was that I spent a lot of time - while developing other
components - thinking about how GoodFriend should work (both interface and
internally) before even starting on it. This included the dependency system, which
went through several versions in myhead before making anything.
