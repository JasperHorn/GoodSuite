  <h1>Good is not installed</h1>
  <p>The Page in question tried to use the Good framework, but Good,
     the center piece of the framework has not been installed.
	 <a href="Friend/">GoodFriend</a> should be able to install it
	 (and itself).</p>
  <p>If you do not have GoodFriend you should contact your supplier
     of Good, as Good is worthless without it. Besides installing
	 Good and itself, GoodFriend will also be the place to install
	 other modules.</p>
