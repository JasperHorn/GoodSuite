GoodMemory is the component that allows you to use GoodManners as an interface
to a database.
The system being as modular as it is, GoodManners can't really do anything on
its own. It's basically nothing but an interface - without an implementation.
So you will need to have an implementation there, and as databases are by far
the most common form of persistent storage on the web (and because GoodManners
is modelled to work naturally with databases) GoodMemory is the obvious choice.

I know Memory on a hardware level is about ram, and this is actually a
component that is about persistent storage (databases in this case, though it's
possible ot have a database in RAM, it isn't a very common thing). However, that
is just not the kind of memory that this name is about.
Think about it. The RAM is the short-term memory. The persistent storage is the
long-term memory. If someone were to compliment you on your good memory, he or
she probably wouldn't be talking about your short-term memory. That's what this
is about.
It is interesting to note that this was the last component to be made before any
components other than GoodLooking had version numbers. The idea here is that
what was once GoodManners, was now split up into GoodRolemodel, GoodService,
GoodManners and GoodMemory. Together, they were still the abstraction between
your code and the database, but everything was much more modular now. However,
they were still made in succession and the real test for the entire system was
all those parts working together.
It was only after that test that they all got promoted to INT01 status.
