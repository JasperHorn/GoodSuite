GoodLooking is the template engine of The Good Suite.
It allows you to use templates which define the looks of your website completely
seperate from the bussiness logic.
This way, it takes the role of the View (server-side) in MVC.

GoodLooking is basically where this all started, it is the origin of the entire
Good Suite. Basically, it started off with me just wanting a templating engine
and not getting stuck to an entire framework. Ironically, it spawned just that:
an entire framework.
It should be said that some of that original sentiment has been kept, though.
Even as the features of the system grow, everything is still made with a very
modular approack. This means that if you want nothing but a template engine,
you can use GoodLooking and just not install any other part of the Good Suite.
This also means that instead of a template engine, you want only a way to make
your database access easier, you can just install only the components for that.
Of course, the richest experience will be when you use the entire system, but
the system recognizes that that isn't the right experience for everyone.
