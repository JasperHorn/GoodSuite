GoodService is the component that takes an abstract model tree created by
GoodRolemodel and turns it into a php class for you.
In terms of usage, this means it makes server side model classes for you out of
the datamodel files you made yourself.
That's also where it names comes from - it's SERVER-side making of model
classes.
It provides hooks for other components to modify the result classes. Typical
uses of this system include GoodManners hooking into this to turn the result
into a `Store` (thus letting you store the data in it in - for example - your
database) and Good... hooking into this system to add a function that
instantiates a javscript version of the class (one created from the same
datamodel files) with the current data of the class.

GoodService is the second component to spring out of the cutting up of 
GoodManners into the different components you need right now to access a
database. As such, it is the third component of which a complete version was
made.
I know it's name isn't too good, and I think that thinking of a name actually
did hold up the making of the component (by half a day or so). It took me quite
some time to come up with even this, as it's just a hard thing to name.
I think it is also the first name you shouldn't precede with "you are/have (a)"
(instead, it should be preceded with "you provide").
