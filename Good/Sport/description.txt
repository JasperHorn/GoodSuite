Good... makes it possible to use any `store` as it were the file system.
It can be used by different components that compile to files, to make sure the
compiled files aren't stored on the file system (but for example, in the 
database).
In this usage it doesn't really have a place in MVC, but rather it is a tool
for use by other components that live just about anywhere else.
Of course, it can also be used by a user of The Good Suite rather than other
components, in which it will be able to make systems that aren't too flexible
more flexible. Or one may find a completely different use for it...
Used this way I suppose it makes most sense to use it in the Model of MVC, but
I guess that it actually still lives somewhat outside of MVC.

Good... was the second component of The Good Suite to be concepted. At that
time, though, it was known as GoodSport. As I didn't think this name had
enough of a connection to what it did, it was changed.
The idea was that after spewing out the earliest versions of GoodLooking,
I decided that the next feature to be added was the ability to compile
templates to the database as it could be hard to make the system have
access to the file system at times (it shouldn't be, but sometimes it is).
I investigated the different ways of making this possible, and a very first
prototype of what you now know as Good... was made.
It won out over other ways, and I suppose this was really when The Good Suite
was born, as I decided that this wasn't going to be a new feature of
GoodLooking, but rather a different component in the same big picture.
Before building a real version of Good..., though, I decided that it would
use other components (well, actually just one at first, but this changed
along the way) to access the database. This lead to GoodRolemodel, GoodService,
GoodManners and GoodMemory being created before any real work was done on
Good...
Man, the changes to a system that a single new feature can cause...
